# decide

This is all about "Poke The Box" strategy. I explore various things that matters to my day to day work. I do it in a manner that is easy to understand & replicate. This poking in turn helps me _(& hopefully others)_ to provide enough ideas, justification, tangible facts to decide on something that may be bothering me at any point in time.

### How easy is this to understand?
I try to use best programming practices. I am also open to the idea of using Unit Testing as a means to explain complex things.
